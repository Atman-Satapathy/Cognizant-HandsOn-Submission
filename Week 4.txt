1. Since ServiceNow scripting relies heavily on JavaScript, having a solid grasp of JavaScript basics is crucial. This includes understanding variables, data types, functions, control structures, and object-oriented programming principles.
Client Scripts- Run on the client-side (browser) and are used to manage form behavior and client-side logic.
Server Scripts- Execute on the server-side and include Business Rules, Script Includes, Scheduled Jobs, and REST APIs.
UI Actions- Allow customization of form buttons, context menu options, and other user interface elements.
Business Rules- Run server-side logic in response to record operations (insert, update, delete).
Script Includes- Reusable server-side scripts that can be called from other scripts.

Variables and Data Types
Variables: Variables store data values and are declared using var, let, or const.

var is function-scoped and can be re-declared.
let is block-scoped and can be re-assigned but not re-declared within the same scope.
const is block-scoped and cannot be re-assigned or re-declared.

Primitive Types: Strings, Numbers, Booleans, null, undefined, and Symbols.
Object Types: Arrays, Functions, and more complex objects.

Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, etc.

Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=

Logical Operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)

Conditionals: if, else if, else, switch

Loops: for, while, do...while

Function Declaration: A named function can be declared using the function keyword.

Function Expression: Functions can also be assigned to variables.

Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for writing functions.

Objects: Key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be any data type.

Arrays: Ordered collections of values.

Try...Catch: Used to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.

2.Different Client Scripts are:
onLoad()- Executes when a form is loaded.
onChange()- Runs when a field value changes.
onSubmit()- Executes when a form is submitted.
onCellEdit()- Triggered when a cell value is changed in a list.

4.Minimize the use of synchronous GlideRecord queries in client scripts and avoid excessive use of gs.info() in production environments. 
Use the ServiceNow Script Debugger and logs to test and debug scripts. Ensure you handle errors gracefully to prevent disruptions.
Be mindful of script execution times, especially in business rules and scheduled jobs. Optimize queries and avoid unnecessary operations.

5.Automate Notifications- Write scripts to automatically notify users based on specific conditions (e.g., SLA breaches).
Custom Form Logic- Implement custom form logic to validate data or auto-populate fields based on user input or other conditions.
Integrate with External Systems- Use REST APIs and script includes to integrate ServiceNow with external systems and automate data exchange.
